      summary: Create Health Check
      description: Creates a new health check.To create a new health check, send a
        POST request to the/2013-04-01/healthcheck resource. The request body must
        include a documentwith a CreateHealthCheckRequest element. The response returns
        theCreateHealthCheckResponse element, containing the health check ID specifiedwhen
        adding health check to a resource record set. For information about adding
        health checksto resource record sets, see ResourceRecordSet:HealthCheckId
        in ChangeResourceRecordSets. If you are registering EC2 instances with an
        Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) loadbalancer, do not create Amazon Route 53 health
        checks for the EC2 instances. When you register anEC2 instance with a load
        balancer, you configure settings for an ELB health check, whichperforms a
        similar function to an Amazon Route 53 health check.You can associate health
        checks with failover resource record sets in a private hostedzone. Note the
        following:Amazon Route 53 health checkers are outside the VPC. To check the
        health of an endpointwithin a VPC by IP address, you must assign a public
        IP address to the instance in theVPC.You can configure a health checker to
        check the health of an external resource thatthe instance relies on, such
        as a database server.You can create a CloudWatch metric, associate an alarm
        with the metric, and then create ahealth check that is based on the state
        of the alarm. For example, you might create a CloudWatchmetric that checks
        the status of the Amazon EC2 StatusCheckFailed metric, add analarm to the
        metric, and then create a health check that is based on the state of thealarm.
        For information about creating CloudWatch metrics and alarms by using the
        CloudWatch console,see the Amazon CloudWatch User Guide.
